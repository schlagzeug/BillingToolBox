            in the text underlying the annotation. The coordinates for each quadrilateral are given in 
            the order<br />
            x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 x4 y4<br />
            specifying the quadrilateral's four vertices in counterclockwise order. The text is oriented
            with respect to the edge connecting points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).

            This flag is used to avoid infinite recursion when synchronizing fields (field xfaA is 
            updated and tried to sync with acroA. acroA is updated because of sync and it triggers
            a new update of xfaA. This would go infinitely without this flag).

      <remarks>The Facing Identification Mark, or FIM, is a bar code designed by the 
            United States Postal Service to assist in the automated processing of mail. 
            The FIM is a set of vertical bars printed on the envelope or postcard near 
            the upper edge, just to the left of the postage area (the area where the postage 
            stamp or its equivalent is placed). The FIM is intended for use primarily on 
            preprinted envelopes and postcards and is applied by the company printing the 
            envelopes or postcards, not by the USPS.<br />
            FIM barcodes support only 4 data strings: "A", "B", "C", and "D", one string for
            each FIM barcode.

      <remarks>The color table data must be m * (maxIndex + 1) bytes long, where m is the 
            number of color components in the base color space. Each byte is an unsigned integer 
            in the range 0 to 255 that is scaled to the range of the corresponding color component 
            in the base color space; that is, 0 corresponds to the minimum value in the range for 
            that component, and 255 corresponds to the maximum.</remarks>

            Base class for all the classes that

            </summary>
      <remarks>
            This class is the base class for implementing
            user defined logical units. All classes that represent a custom
            defined logical unit must implement two methods: ToPDFUnitX( float unit ) and
            ToPDFUnitY( float unit ). These 2 methods need to define the mapping between the
            logical unit and measure unit used by pdf files, which is the point 
            (1/72 inches). These 2 methods allow to define custom mappings between
            logical unit and pdf unit (point) for each axis. The mapping between the
            logical unit and the pdf unit shows how many pdf units 
            correspond to a logical unit.

            </summary>
      <remarks>A color-key mask allows to specify a range of
            colors within an image to be treated as transparent 
            when the image is painted on the page. All the colors
            between startColor and endColor will be treated as
            transparent. <br />A color is considered higher than startColor
            and lower than endColor when all its components meet this
            considition individually. For example, in RGB colorspace,
            being given the color C with its components (Cr, Cg, Cb),
            then startColor (SC) &lt;= C &lt;= endColor (EC) when:<br />
            SCr &lt;= Cr &lt;= ECr AND SCg &lt;= Cg &lt;= ECg AND SCb &lt;= Cb &lt;= ECb.<br /><b>Note:</b> A color image mask should not be used with jpeg images
            because they use a lossy image compression and unwanted effects might appear.

            <p>Supported by Compact .NET Edition.</p></summary>
      <remarks>
            A numbering range defines a set of consecutive pages that use the

            page specified by <see cref="P:O2S.Components.PDF4NET.PageNumberingRange.StartPageIndex" /> property and ends at
            the last page of the document. If multiple numbering ranges are defined,
            then a numbering range ends where the next numbering range starts.
            The numbering ranges of a document are ordered ascending by 
            <see cref="P:O2S.Components.PDF4NET.PageNumberingRange.StartPageIndex" /> property.
            <para>
            For example, a document has an introduction on first 3 pages, then
            it starts first chapter from the 4th page. A numbering range starting 
            at index zero can be defined for the introduction using roman numerals, 
            then a new numbering range can be defined starting at index 3 using 
            arabic numerals. For this new range, the start page number can be set 
            to 1, this being the first logical page, although it is the 4th 
            physical page in the document.

      <remarks>
            This function is used to draw an image on the canvas. The top left corner
            of the image is placed at left,top coordinates. The width and the height
            of the drawn images are set by the corresponding parameters. The image is
            rotated around the top left corner with a number of degrees specified by
            the orientation parameter. Depending on the keepAspectRatio parameter,
            the width or the height can be computed automatically.
            <para>Based on the keepAspectRatio parameter,
            the width or the height can be computed automatically. If KeepWidth is used,
            then the height is adjusted to obtain the original image ratio. The return of 
            the function is the calculated height. If KeepHeight is used,
            then the width is adjusted to obtain the original image ratio. The return of 
            the function is the calculated width. If KeepNone or KeepBoth are used,
            then the given width and height parameters are used. The return of 
            the function is -1.

            The ImageQuality parameter specifies the level of jpeg compression to be applied
            on the image saved to pdf file. A higher value means high quality but low 
            compression, a lower value means low quality but high compression. The values
            accepted by this parameter vary from 1 to 100. The value of this parameter
            is ignored when a jpeg image is used.

            The activeFrame parameter specifies the frame index within a multiframe image. 
            When a multiframe image is requested to be drawn on the page, this index 
            selects the frame within the image that will be drawn on the page. This 
            property is used by images that include multiple images within the same file,
            like gif or tiff. The other supported image formats ignore this property.
            This index is zero based. If the frame does not exist in the image, then
            the first frame will be considered for display.

            The default logical unit used to position graphic objects on the page

            During the drawing operations, the logical unit can be changed in order
            to achieve desired functionality. In this way, some objects can be positioned
            on the page using one logical unit, while other objects can be positioned
            using another logical unit.
            </remarks>
      <example>
            The following example show how to draw different objects on the page
            using different logical units to position them.

      <example>
            The following example sets the direction of the Y axis to be from

            A byte array specifying the user password for the

      <remarks>A user password restricts access to a pdf document. When the
            pdf document is opened, the viewer requests the user to enter a password,
            if a user password has been set on the document. 
            If the user password has not been set (this property
            is set to null), then the viewer opens the document without requesting
            a password. When the pdf document is open with a user password (or
            without one), the access to the document is restricted by the access rights
            associated with the document (allow print, etc).

            An owner password allows the user to get full control over the
